        Football, often referred to as soccer in some countries, is a dynamic team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team’s net, primarily using feet, but players can also use their bodies, except for the goalkeeper, who can use their hands within the penalty area. Renowned for its global appeal, football fosters a sense of community and rivalry, with major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup captivating millions around the world. The sport is celebrated not only for 
        its thrilling matches and athleticism but also for its ability to unite fans across cultures and 
        backgrounds.
